## Documentation

**NOTE: In v2.0.0 Configuration has been changed**

This plugin collects a number of commands and listener plugins that I
find useful and wanted to have in a single plugin rather through
multiple ones.  The available commands and listener modules can be
configured.  This allows this plugin to co-exist peacefully with other
plugins.

### Command Reference

The following commands are available:

* **after** _<seconds>_ _<command>_  
  schedule command after a number of seconds  

  Will schedule to run *command* after *seconds*

* **as** _<player>_ _<command>_  
  run command as somebody else  

* **at** _<time>_ _[:]_ _command_  
  schedule command at an appointed date/time  

  Will schedule to run *command* at the given date/time.  This uses
  php's [strtotime](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php)
  function so _times_ must follow the format described in
  [Date and Time Formats](http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.php).

* **blowup** _<player>_ _[yield]_ **[magic]** **[normal]**  
  explode a player  

  Explodes `player` with an explosion with the given `yield` (a number).
  If `magic` is specified no damage will be taken by blocks.  The
  default is `normal`, where blocks do get damaged.

* **burn** _<player>_ _[secs]_  
  Burns the specified player  

  Sets `player` on fire for the specified number of seconds.
  Default is 15 seconds.

* **clearinv** _<player>_

* **entities** _[subcommand_ _[options]_  
  entity management  

  By default it will show the current entities.  The following
  sub-commands are available:
  - **entities** **ls** _[world]_
     - Show entities in _[world]_ (or current world if not specified).
  - **entities** **tiles** _[world]_

* **freeze|thaw** [_player_|**--hard|--soft**]  
  freeze/unfreeze a player so they cannot move.  

  Stops players from moving.  If no player specified it will show
  the list of frozen players.

  If `--hard` or `--soft` is specified instead of a player name, it
  will change the freeze mode.

  This is a shortcut to `/give` that lets player get items for
  themselves.

  Change your gamemode to _Creative_.  
* **gms**  
  Change your gamemode to _Survival_.  
* **heal** _[player]_ _[ammount]_  
  Restore health to a player  

  Heals a player.  If the amount is positive it will heal, if negative
  the player will be hurt.  The units are in 1/2 hearts.

* **mute|unmute** _[player]_  
  mutes/unmutes a player so they can not use chat  

  Stops players from chatting.  If no player specified it will show
  the list of muted players.

* **opms** _[msg]_  
  sends a message to ops only  

  Sends chat messages that are only see by ops.  Only works with ops
  that are on-line at the moment.  If you no ops are on-line you

  To stop enter `/prefix` by itself (or `prefix` at the console).
  Usage examples:

  - Send multiple `/as player` commands in a row.
  - Start a private chat `/tell player` with another player.
  - You prefer commands over chat: `-n /`

* **pushtp** _<player>_ _[target]_  
  Saves current location and teleport  
* **rcon** **[--add|--rm|--ls|id]** _<command>_  
  rcon client

    - Sends the `command` to the connection `id`.
  should use the `rpt` command.

* **rpt** [_message_|**read|clear** _<all|##>_]  
  report an issue to ops  

  Logs/reports an issue to server ops.  These issues are stored in a
  a file which can be later read by the server operators.  Use this
  when there are **no** ops on-line.  If there are ops on-line you
  should use the `opms` command.

  The following ops only commands are available:
  - **rpt** **read** _[##]_
    - reads reports.  You can specify the page by specifying a number.
  - **rpt** **clear** _<all|##>_
    - will delete the specified report or if `all`, all the reports.

  If `on` it will activate service mode.  In service mode new
  players can not join (unless they are ops).  Existing players
  can remain but may be kicked manually by any ops.

* **setarmor** _[player]_ _[piece]_ _<type>_  
  Sets armor (even in creative)  

  This command lets you armor up.  It can armor up creative players too.

  This will toggle your shield status.

  If nothing specified it will list available reports.  These are
  of the form of `timings.txt` or `timings1.txt`.

  `timings1.txt`.
* **slay** _<player>_ _[msg]_  
  Kills the specified player  

  Kills a player with an optional `message`.

* **spawn**  
  Teleport player to spawn point  

* **spectator|unspectator** _[player]_  
  toggle a player's spectator mode  

  `/spectator` will turn a player into an spectator.  In this mode
  players can move but not interact (i.e. can't take/give damage,
  can't place/break blocks, etc).

  If no player was specified, it will list spectators.
* **summon** _<player>_ _[message]_

Commands scheduled by `at` and `after` will only run as
long as the server is running.  These scheduled commands will *not*
survive server reloads or reboots.


### Module reference

#### join-mgr

Announce joining ops, and show server motd

This listener module will broadcast a message for ops joining
a server.

Also, it will show the server's motd on connect.

#### repeater

Uses `!!` to repeat command with changes

If you want to repeat a previous command enter `!!` *without* any `/`
in front.  This works for commands and chat messages.

You can optionally append additional text to `!!` to do certain
things:

* `!!` number
  - Will let you paginate output.  For example, entering:
		/mw ls
		!!2
		!!3
  This will start showing the output of `/mw ls` and consecutive pages.
* `!!` `/`
  - if you forgot the `/` in front, this command will add it.  Example:
		help
		!!/
* `!!` text
  - Will append `text` to the previous command.  For example:
		/gamemode
		!! survival john
  This will show the usage of survival, the next line will change the
  gamemode of john to survival.
* `!!` str1 str2
  - Will repeat the previous command replacing `str1` with `str2`
    Example:
		/give player drt
		!!drt dirt
  This will change `drt` into `dirt`.
* `!!`^ text
  - Will insert `text` at the beginning of the command.


### Configuration

Configuration is throug the `config.yml` file.
The following sections are defined:

#### features


This section you can enable/disable commands and listener modules.
You do this in order to avoid conflicts between different
PocketMine-MP plugins.  It has one line per feature:

   feature: true|false

If `true` the feature is enabled.  if `false` the feature is disabled.

#### freeze-thaw


* hard-freeze (false): if `true` no movement is allowed.  If `false`,
  turning is allowed but not walking/running/flying, etc.

#### join-mgr


* adminjoin - broadcast whenever an op joins
* servermotd - show the server's motd when joining

#### rcon-client


This section configures the rcon client connections.  You can configure
this section through the *rcon* command.
