## Documentation

This plugin collects a number of commands and listener plugins that I
find useful and wanted to have in a single plugin rather through
multiple ones.  The available commands and listener modules can be
configured.  This allows this plugin to co-exist peacefully with other
plugins.

### Command Reference

The following commands are available:

* **after** _&lt;seconds&gt;_ _&lt;command&gt;_|list|cancel _&lt;id&gt;_  
  schedule command after a number of seconds  

  Will schedule to run *command* after *seconds*.

  schedule command at an appointed date/time  

  Will schedule to run *command* at the given date/time.  This uses
  php's [strtotime](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php)
  function so _times_ must follow the format described in
  [Date and Time Formats](http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.php).
  The **list** sub command will show all the queued commands.
  The **cancel** sub command allows you to cancel queued commands.

* **blowup** _&lt;player&gt;_ _[yield]_ **[magic]** **[normal]**  
  explode a player  

  Explodes `player` with an explosion with the given `yield` (a number).

  default is `normal`, where blocks do get damaged.

### Module reference

#### blood-particles

Display particles when a player gets hit

#### broadcast-ft

Broadcast player's using FastTransfer

This listener module will broadcast when a player uses FastTransfer

#### broadcast-tp

Broadcast player's teleports

This listener module will broadcast when a player teleports to
another location.

#### CommandSelector

Adds "@" prefixes.

See
[Command Prefixes](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands#Target_selector_arguments)
for an explanation on prefixes.

This only implements the following prefixes:

- @a - all players
- @e - all entities (including players)
- @r - random player/entity

The following selectors are implemented:

- c: (only for @r),count
- m: game mode
- type: entity type, use Player for player.
- name: player's name`
- w: world

#### join-mgr

Announce joining ops, and show server motd

This listener module will broadcast a message for ops joining
a server.

Also, it will show the server's motd on connect.

#### repeater

Uses `!!` to repeat command with changes

If you want to repeat a previous command enter `!!` *without* any `/`
in front.  This works for commands and chat messages.

You can optionally append additional text to `!!` to do certain
things:

* `!!` number
  - Will let you paginate output.  For example, entering:
		/mw ls
		!!2
		!!3
  This will start showing the output of `/mw ls` and consecutive pages.
* `!!` `/`
  - if you forgot the `/` in front, this command will add it.  Example:
		help
		!!/
* `!!` text
  - Will append `text` to the previous command.  For example:
		/gamemode
		!! survival john
  This will show the usage of survival, the next line will change the
  gamemode of john to survival.
* `!!` str1 str2
  - Will repeat the previous command replacing `str1` with `str2`
    Example:
		/give player drt
		!!drt dirt
  This will change `drt` into `dirt`.
* `!!`^ text
  - Will insert `text` at the beginning of the command.


### Configuration

Configuration is through the `config.yml` file.
The following sections are defined:

#### broadcast-tp

*  world: world broadcast setting. If true, will broadcast teleports accross worlds.
*  local: local broadcast setting. This will broadcast teleports that go beyond this number.

#### cmd-selector

*  max-commands: Limit the ammount of commands generated by @ prefixes

#### features


This section you can enable/disable commands and listener modules.
You do this in order to avoid conflicts between different
PocketMine-MP plugins.  It has one line per feature:

   feature: true|false

If `true` the feature is enabled.  if `false` the feature is disabled.

#### freeze-thaw

*  hard-freeze: how hard to freeze players. If `true` no movement is allowed.  If `false`, turning is allowed but not walking/running/flying, etc.

#### join-mgr

*  adminjoin: broadcast whenever an op joins
*  servermotd: show the server's motd when joining

#### query-hosts


This section configures the query connections.  You can configure
this section through the *query* command.

#### rcon-client


This section configures the rcon client connections.  You can configure
this section through the *rcon* command.

## Translations

This plugin will honour the server language configuration.  The
languages currently available are:

* English

You can provide your own message file by creating a file called
`messages.ini` in the plugin config directory.  Check
[github](https://github.com/alejandroliu/pocketmine-plugins/tree/master/GrabBag)
for sample files.

## Additional Libraries

The following third party libraries are included:

* [xPaw's MinecraftQuery](http://xpaw.me GitHub: https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Minecraft-Query)

## Known issues

* Query:
  * Queries are done in the main thread.  Should be moved as an AsyncTask.
  * Queries to the same server do not work.

# Changes

  * (@SM11) Edit tiles by location (instead of by id)
* 2.2.5:
  * Fixed bugs
  * CmdSelMgr: configure max
  * gift command / broadcast
  * Switched MPMU::itemName for ItemName::str
* 2.2.4:
