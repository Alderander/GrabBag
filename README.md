Documentation
-------------

This plugin collects a number of commands and listener plugins that I
find useful and wanted to have in a single plugin rather through
multiple ones.  The available commands and listener modules can be
configured.  This allows this plugin to co-exist peacefully with other
plugins.

### Commands:

* *players*  
  Show connected players and locations, health.
* *ops*  
  Display a list of Server Ops and their on-line status.
* *as* *player* *cmd* _[opts]_  
  Run *cmd* as a different *player*.  If you want to send a `chat`
  line as *player* use `chat` for *cmd*.
* *gms*  
  Switch to survival game mode
* *gmc*  
  Switch to creative game mode
* *gma*  
  Switch to adventure game mode
* *slay* *player* _[message]_  
  Kills a player immediatly
* *heal* _[player_ _[value]]_  
  Restore health to a player
* *whois* *player*  
  Show player info
* *showtimings* _[report|clear]_ _[page]_  
  Show the timings data from the `/timings` command.
* *seearmor* *player*  
  Show player's armor
* *seeinv* *player*  
  Show player's inventory
* *get* *item[:damage]* _[amount]_  
  Obtain an *item*.  When the item name contain spaces in the name,
  use `_` instead.
* *shield* _[up|down]_  
  Show shield status.  Or raise/lower shields.
* *servicemode* _[on|off]_  _[message]_
  In servicemode, new connections are not allowed.  Existing users are
  OK.  Ops (gb.servicemode.allow) can always login.
* *opms* text
  Send a message that can only be seen by ops or by the console.  You
  should use the *ops* command to see if there are any server ops
  on-line.

### Command repeater

If you want to repeat a previous command enter `!!` *without* any `/`
in front.  This works for commands and chat messages.

You can optionally append additional text to `!!` to do certain
things:

* `!!` number  
  Will let you paginate output.  For example, entering:
	/mw ls
	!!2
	!!3
  This will start showing the output of `/mw ls` and consecutive pages.
* `!!` text  
  Will append `text` to the previous command.  For example:
	/gamemode
	!! survival john
  This will show the usage of survival, the next line will change the
  gamemode of john to survival.
* `!!` str1 str2
  Will repate the previous command replacing `str1` with `str2`
  Example:
	/give player drt
	!!drt dirt
  This will change `drt` into `dirt`.

### Listener Modules

Also this plugin supports the following modules:

* adminjoin : Broadcast a message when an op joins.
* spawnitems : Initialize a player inventory when they spawn.  
  It will place a configuratble list of inventory items.  Note that it
  only does it for users who start without any inventory.  As soon as
  they start owning stuff, spawnitems will stop working for them.
* spawnarmor : Initialize a player armor when they spawn.  
  I will configure a player's armor through a configurable list.  Note
  that it only does it for users without armor.
* compasstp: When holding a compass tap the screen for 1 second, will
  teleport you in the direciton you are facing.

### Configuration

Configuration is through the `config.yml` file:

	---
	spawn:
	  armor:
	    head: '-'
	    body: chainmail
	    legs: leather
	    boots: leather
	  items:
	  - "272:0:1"
	  - "17:0:16"
	  - "364:0:5"
	...

The `spawn` section contains two lists:

* `armor`: defines the list of armor that players will spawn with.
* `items`: lists the `item_id`:`damage`:`count` for initial items that
  will be placed in the players inventory at spawn time.

### Activating/De-activating modules

There is a `modules.yml` that by default activates all modules.  You
can de-activate modules by commenting them out from `modules.yml`.

### Permission Nodes:

* gb.cmd.players - Allow players command
* gb.cmd.ops - list server ops
* gb.cmd.sudo - allow to run commands as somebody else
* gb.cmd.gms: allow switch gamemode to survival
* gb.cmd.gmc: allow switch gamemode to creative

* gb.cmd.seearmor: Show player's armor
