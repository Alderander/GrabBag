**DO NOT POST QUESTIONS/BUG-REPORTS/REQUESTS IN THE REVIEWS**

It is difficult to carry a conversation in the reviews.  If you
have a question/bug-report/request please use the
[Thread](http://forums.pocketmine.net/threads/grabbag.7524/) for
that.  You are more likely to get a response and help that way.

_NOTE:_

This documentation was last updated for version **2.5.0**.

A miscellaneous collection of commands and listener modules.  **All**
features can be configured to be _disabled|enabled_ so as to co-exist
with other plugins.  Furthermore, permissions are added on the fly when
features are enabled, so if you only enable a few features, your permission
list will not be very long.

## Documentation

This plugin collects a number of commands and listener plugins that I
find useful and wanted to have in a single plugin rather through
multiple ones.  The available commands and listener modules can be
configured.  This allows this plugin to co-exist peacefully with other
plugins.

### Command Reference

The following commands are available:

<!-- template: gd2/subcmds.md -->
* afk: Toggles AFK status<br/>
   usage: **afk** _[message]_
  
  Implements basic Away From Key functionality.  This is actually
  implemented on the basis of the **freeze-thaw**, **mute-unmute** and
  **shield** modules.  These have to be active for this command to work.
* after: schedule command after a number of seconds<br/>
  usage: **after** _&lt;seconds&gt;_ _&lt;command&gt;|list|cancel_ _&lt;id&gt;_
  
  Will schedule to run *command* after *seconds*.
  The **list** sub command will show all the queued commands.
  The **cancel** sub command allows you to cancel queued commands.
  
* alias: Create a new command alias<br/>
  usage: **alias** **[-f]** _&lt;alias&gt;_ _&lt;command&gt;_ _[options]_

  Will schedule to run *command* at the given date/time.  This uses
  php's [strtotime](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php)
  function so _times_ must follow the format described in
  [Date and Time Formats](http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.php).
  The **list** sub command will show all the queued commands.
  The **cancel** sub command allows you to cancel queued commands.

<!-- snippet: cmdnotes  -->

Commands scheduled by **at** and **after** will only run as
long as the server is running.  These scheduled commands will *not*
survive server reloads or reboots.  If you want persistent commands,
it is recommended that you use a plugin like
[TimeCommander](http://forums.pocketmine.net/plugins/timecommander.768/).

<!-- end-include -->

### Module reference

<!-- php:$h=4; -->
<!-- template: gd2/mods.md -->
#### blood-particles

Display particles when a player gets hit

#### broadcast-ft

Broadcast player's using FastTransfer

This listener module will broadcast when a player uses FastTransfer

#### broadcast-tp

Broadcast player teleports

This listener module will broadcast when a player teleports to
another location.  It also generates some smoke and plays a sound.


#### cmd-selector

Implements "@" command prefixes

Please refer to the CommandSelector section

#### custom-death

Customize what happens when a player dies

Currently this module only supports the _KeepInv_ feature.
This feature lets you select what happens with a player's inventory
when they get killed.

- default : This is the PocketMine-MP default, which the player
  loses their inventory and it is drop as pickable items.
- keep : The player gets to keep their inventory and nothing gets
  dropped.
- nodrops : The player loses their inventory but no items are dropped.
  This is useful to reduce the amount of Item Entities which in heavy
  used servers may cause lag.
- perms: Player permissions are checked on what to do.  Players must
  have one permission between these:
  - gb.cdeath.default
  - gb.cdeath.keep
  - gb.cdeath.nodrops


#### join-mgr

Customize players when they joins the server

This module does the following:

- Broadcast a message when an op joins
- Show the server's motd on connect.
- Keeps slots reserved for Ops (or VIPs)
- Players can start with equipment
- Always Spawn functionality

#### mega-slots

Merges the slot count of multiple servers

This module requres either the **motd-task** or **query-task**
to be enabled.

#### motd-task

Background task to ping configured remote servers

This module will ping servers in the server list to retrieve
motd/cache

#### query-task

Background task to query configured remote servers

This module will query servers in the server list to retrieve
query cacheable data.

#### repeater

Uses **!!** to repeat command with changes

If you want to repeat a previous command enter **!!** *without* any "/"
in front.  This works for commands and chat messages.

You can optionally append additional text to **!!** to do certain
things:

* **!!** number
  - Will let you paginate output.  For example, entering:
    - /mw ls
    - !!2
    - !!3
  - This will start showing the output of **/mw ls** and consecutive pages.
* **!!** /
  - if you forgot the "/" in front, this command will add it.  Example:
    - help
    - !!/
* **!!** _text_
  - Will append _text_ to the previous command.  For example:
    - /gamemode
    - !! survival john
  - This will show the usage of survival, the next line will change the
    gamemode of john to survival.
* **!!** str1 str2
  - Will repeat the previous command replacing `str1` with `str2`
    Example:
    - /give player drt
    - !!drt dirt
  - This will change **drt** into **dirt**.
* **!!^** _text_
  - Will insert _text_ at the beginning of the command.

### Command Selectors
<!-- snippet: cmdselector  -->

This adds "@" prefixes for commands.
See
[Command Prefixes](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands#Target_selector_arguments)
for an explanation on prefixes.

This only implements the following prefixes:

- @a - all players
- @e - all entities (including players)
- @r - random player/entity

The following selectors are implemented:

- c: (only for @r),count
- m: game mode
- type: entity type, use Player for player.
- name: player's name
- w: world

<!-- end-include -->
